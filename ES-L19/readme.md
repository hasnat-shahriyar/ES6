### Code Breakdown:

1. **Function Definitions:**

   - `callMyName(name, callback)`: This function takes two arguments, `name` and `callback`. Inside the function, a local variable `myAge` is defined and assigned the value `24`. Then, it calls the `callback` function with `myAge` as the argument, and finally, it logs a message to the console.
   - `dob(age)`: This function takes one argument, `age`, and logs a message to the console.

2. **Function Call:**
   - `callMyName('Hasnat Shahiyar', dob)`: This calls the `callMyName` function with `'Hasnat Shahiyar'` as the `name` argument and the `dob` function as the `callback` argument.

### Sequence of Execution:

1. **Initial Call:**

   - `callMyName` is invoked with `'Hasnat Shahiyar'` and `dob`.

2. **Inside `callMyName`:**

   - `myAge` is set to `24`.
   - `callback(myAge)` is executed, which is effectively `dob(24)`.

3. **Inside `dob`:**

   - `dob` logs `And my age is 24` to the console.

4. **Back to `callMyName`:**
   - `console.log(`Hello My name is ${name}`)` is executed, which logs `Hello My name is Hasnat Shahiyar`.

### Visual Representation:

Here is a flow diagram to illustrate the sequence:

```
callMyName('Hasnat Shahiyar', dob)
         |
         v
    +--------------+
    |  myAge = 24  |
    +--------------+
         |
         v
callback(myAge) (== dob(24))
         |
         v
  +---------------+
  | dob function: |
  | console.log   |
  | `And my age   |
  | is ${age}`    |
  +---------------+
         |
         v
console.log('And my age is 24')
         |
         v
back to callMyName
         |
         v
console.log(`Hello My name is ${name}`)
         |
         v
console.log('Hello My name is Hasnat Shahiyar')
```

### Summary:

- `callMyName` sets `myAge` to `24` and calls the `dob` function with `myAge` as the argument.
- `dob` logs `And my age is 24`.
- After `dob` finishes, `callMyName` logs `Hello My name is Hasnat Shahiyar`.

This sequence ensures that the age is logged before the name in the console.
