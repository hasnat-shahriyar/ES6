// Comparing two primitive values
const a = 2;
const b = 2;

if (a === b) {
    console.log("They are the same");
} else {
    console.log("They are different");
}

// Output: They are the same

// In this case, the values of 'a' and 'b' are both 2, which is a primitive type. 
// When you compare primitive values like numbers using '===', it checks if their values are identical, so they are considered the same.
